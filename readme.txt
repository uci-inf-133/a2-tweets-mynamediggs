4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I didn't consult any classmates or individuals as part of this assignment.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

Typing out the query for the text search interface is extremely laggy for the first letter,
and I'm not sure if it's supposed to take that long. In terms of functionality, the search
still works. 

I didn't hardcode the '???' section in the activities.js section because I didn't 
read the instructions carefully, which may cause variance in the results.
